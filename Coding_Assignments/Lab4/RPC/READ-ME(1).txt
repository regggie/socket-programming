To install and configure RPCGEN :
1. First check if rpc in already installed or not using command,
rpcinfo

2.If not install RPCGEN using

3.Write .x file to generate source code for RPC
Please refer to filestore.x file

4.Compile it using following command,
rpcgen -a -C filestore.x  (Note that -C is capital)
Above command will generate filestore_*.c files for server and client along with make file to compile

5.Edit filestore_server.c and filestore_client.c for putting your logic in code

6. Compile using make -f Makefile.filestore


commands to run the program :
1. create 2 folders for storing files
   a. At server side make ./filestore folder and place files in it (we have file1.txt and file2.txt there)
   b. At client side make ./clientstore folder

2. run server using ./filestore_server

3. run client using ./filestore_client localhost file1.txt

4. check for file in clientstore dir at client side
